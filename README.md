## Recommender Systems:-
A recommender system, or a recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user. This involves utilizing various state of the art measures to predict a list of items that the user maybe next interested in based on his previous ratings/views.

Notes üìù :- [Recommender Systems curated notes](https://github.com/pxp210115/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/rev_2/Notes/Recommender_systems.MD).

Aim:- To predict a list of movie recommendations that the user has never seen/rated and might like to see in the future. 

Personal Motivation:- I have always been fascinated by how big companies like Apple, Google, Spotify, Amazon and Youtube are able to provide precise recommendations. These recommendation in turn help boost revenue by multiples. I tried to analyze the various state-of the art algorithms to get better user predicitons.
